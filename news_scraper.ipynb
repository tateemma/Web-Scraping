What was more compelling is the fact that Musona was half-fit for this match as a nagging groin injury had threatened to rule him out of the encounter.', 'Warriors’ team doctors had given him a probability of lasting for only 60 minutes but he ended up playing for 77 minutes before he was replaced by Talent Chawapihwa. The strike against the Red Devils was Musona’s 22nd goal in a Warriors’ shirt from 34 caps and there is no doubt that more goals are in store.', 'He also finished as the top goal scorer in Group G with five strikes from six games including a hat-trick against Liberia at the same venue back in 2017. Nigeria’s Odion Ighalo was the overall top scorer during these qualifiers with nine goals while Burundi’s Fiston Razak was second with seven strikes.', 'The hot scoring streak during these 2019 Afcon qualifiers means Musona is now just seven goals behind Benjani Mwaruwari, who is in second place on the Warriors’ all-time goal scorers list with 29 strikes. Musona, who is on loan at Belgian side Lokeren from Anderlecht, can easily overhaul Mwaruwari’s lead considering that the Warriors will soon start taking part in Fifa-sanctioned friendly internationals before they leave for Egypt for the Afcon finals which will start on June 21 and end on July 19.', 'If Musona scores in such matches, the goals will go under his name and will draw him further towards Mwaruwari’s mark. \\xa0\\r\\nIn Egypt, Zimbabwe is guaranteed to play three group matches and in the event the team progresses to the knockout stages that number will also increase.', 'The qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar are also set to start in October this year giving Musona more ample matches to add to his Warriors tally. One cannot stop wondering how many goals Musona could have been on if Zimbabwe had not been banned by Fifa from taking part in qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup which was held in Russia.', 'Due to the Warriors lowly Fifa rankings, the team would have commenced the qualifiers in the first round where they would have played two matches.In the second round another two matches were in store and if the Warriors had progressed to the final group stages, another six matches were on the offer.', 'This means Musona and his current teammates were prejudiced at least 10 international caps by the Zimbabwe Football Association’s failure to pay former coach Valinhos which attracted the Fifa ban. Musona can end the year as Zimbabwe’s second all-time best scorer if he continues with his current form in the Warriors jersey considering all the matches that are lined up this 2019.', 'It is the prospect of overhauling Ndlovu as Zimbabwe’s all-time top scorer that is likely to drive the former Hoffenheim and Kaizer Chiefs striker.

today.\\r\\nThe centre back has one of the ever-present players in Congo’s line-up throughout this qualifying campaign after having played all the previous four matches.\\r\\nWith an inside knowledge of Kadewere, there is no doubt Mayembo will fancy himself in stopping the Warriors forward from getting onto the score sheet. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0', 'Billiat vs Bissiki\\r\\nKhama Billiat has proved to be one of the mainstay players for the Warriors in recent years and there is no doubt that the Kaizer Chiefs forward will be one of the players to watch this afternoon.\\r\\nThe Warriors star has had a season of mixed feelings since leaving Mamelodi Sundowns but he remains a livewire nevertheless.\\r\\nPlaying on the wide National Sports Stadium pitch, Billiat will be key in giving the Warriors

already netted twice during these qualifiers including against Congo in Brazzaville last September.\\r\\nWith Billiat roving between the attacking channels, it will be up to Bissiki to keep an eye on

Ndinga\\r\\nDanny Phiri was injured and did not travel to Monrovia for the Warriors’ defeat to Liberia last November.\\r\\nThe Golden Arrows midfield enforcer was solely missed in that game as Zimbabwe lacked the grit he provides in midfield.\\r\\nAs the home side, the Warriors will be inclined to attack in numbers in order to get the early goal and settle the nerves.\\r\\nIn that regard, Phiri will be key in providing cover to the defence especially when the full backs push high up.\\r\\nHis primary role will be to try and stop any Congo counter attacks and ensure the Warriors retain possession at regular intervals.\\r\\nTouted as the next Jeremy Toulalan during his Auxerre days, Delvin Ndinga did not reach his full potential in Ligue 1 and is now on the books of Turkish club Sivasspor.\\r\\nNow 31, Ndinga is one of the experienced players in Valdo’s side and will be critical in their midfield plan.\\r\\nHe will go head-to-head against Phiri and it will be interesting to see who will come up tops this afternoon. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0', 'Mudimu vs Bahamboula\\r\\nEver since he emerged on the scene in 2018, Alec Mudimu has established himself as one of the most reliable centre backs in the Warriors squad.\\r\\nThe Cefn Druids player is very versatile as he can play at centre back, left back or holding midfield.', 'Throughout this qualifying campaign, Mudimu has stood head and heads at the heart of the Warriors defence.\\r\\nCongo still have a chance of qualifying for Egypt 2019 if they beat the Warriors this afternoon and there is no doubt they will try to catch Zimbabwe on the break.', 'It will be crucial for Mudimu to be the leader of the Warriors backline and stop the Red Devils from scoring this afternoon.\\r\\nWith their top striker Thievy Bifouma missing the trip to Harare through injury, the Red Devils’ scoring burden has fallen on the shoulders of Dylan Bahamboula.', 'The striker is enjoying a purple patch with his Algerian side SC
